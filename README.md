# Project-Identify-Customer-Segments

This is a project to use unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. 

Techniques used in this project include data cleaning, feature selection and re-encoding, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, clustering and result interpretation and summary.
